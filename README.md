# ðŸš€ Completed My Ansible-Terraform-Multi-Environment-IAAC-Project! ðŸš€
# Fell free to clone nad changes according to you, also Please replace Keys from your side.

I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed my Ansible-Terraform-Multi-Environment-IAAC-Project, where I focused on building scalable and automated infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used:
Terraform: Wrote infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to provision multi-environment AWS resources such as EC2, S3, DynamoDB, security groups, and more, ensuring automation and code reusability.
Ansible: Utilized Ansible roles for configuration management to automate the setup and maintenance of application configurations across environments.

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
Terraform for seamless multi-environment infrastructure management and automation.
Ansible for robust configuration management and ensuring consistency across all environments.
Achieved code reusability and infrastructure scalability, enhancing overall efficiency.
Delivered an automated workflow that can scale and adapt to various environments.

This project has strengthened my skills in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), AWS, and Automation, and I am excited to continue exploring new ways to optimize deployments and manage infrastructure.
